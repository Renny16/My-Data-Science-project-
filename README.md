   Assignment Description

This project analyzes a year’s sales data from a pizza restaurant to understand business performance and identify trends. The dataset includes information such as order date, time, pizza type, quantity, and price.
Python was used for the analysis, particularly the Pandas library to organize and analyze the data. Revenue was calculated by multiplying quantity and price, and new columns such as month, day, and hour were created to examine patterns over time. Monthly, daily, and hourly sales were analyzed using grouped summaries.
Matplotlib was used to create visualizations such as bar charts and line graphs to better understand sales trends and peak periods.
The analysis helped identify the highest and lowest performing months, peak sales hours, and bestselling pizzas.
